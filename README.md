# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Analysis Overview 

The purpose of this analysis is 

## Deliverables:
This assignment consists of 3 technical analysis deliverables and a written report on the Credit Risk Analysis. 

1. ***Deliverable 1:*** Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model
2. ***Deliverable 2:*** Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
3. ***Deliverable 3:*** Optimize the Model
4. ***Deliverable 4:*** A Written Report on the Neural Network Model (README.md)

## Results

### Data Preprocessing 
What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
