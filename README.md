# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Analysis Overview 

The purpose of this analysis is to help Beks create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. 

## Deliverables:
This assignment consists of 3 technical analysis deliverables and a written report on the Credit Risk Analysis. 

1. ***Deliverable 1:*** Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model
2. ***Deliverable 2:*** Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
3. ***Deliverable 3:*** Optimize the Model
4. ***Deliverable 4:*** A Written Report on the Neural Network Model (README.md)

## Results

### Data Preprocessing 

- What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model? ***IS_SUCCESSFUL column***

- What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model? ***Every column except the IS_SUCCESSFUL column***

- What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data? ***EIN and NAME columns***

### Compiling, Training and Evaluating the Model
How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model and why? 
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
